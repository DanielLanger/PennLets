<h6>Sublets at Penn aims to simplify the subletting process on campus by offering a single-purpose, easy-to-use platform that connects students with each other. Whether for a summer, a semester, a year or more, Sublets at Penn helps students put all their options out there. We welcome other students looking for housing on campus too. No more Facebook "Class ofâ€¦" wall posts or bathroom stall flyers.</h6>
